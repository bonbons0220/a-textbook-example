The Sloan Digital Sky Survey effort has provided several useful web-based data management tools that may easily be adapted to problems in other disciplines. In our collaboration with the Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, we have utilized SDSS tools such as CasJobs, SciDrive, and SciScript in order to consolidate and automate an existing data-sharing workflow. The result is such that a materials researcher may simply drag and drop simulation results into SciDrive and subsequently receive the desired analysis plots.
